Mortar JS is an open source framework built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) that aims to make interacting and updating data quick, easy, and powerful.  It can best be described as an Admin UI, allowing developers to quickly build sites to interface with an API, allowing users to safely interface with data, without accessing the database directly.

Mortar is made of multiple *Bricks* (components) that work together to display and edit data.  Tables, modal windows, buttons, form inputs and more are all included.  Checkout the [demo](http://playground.mortarjs.io) to see what's included!

## Getting Started
Mortar is very easy to plug and play.  We recommend using the yeoman generator that we've created to get up and running in no time.  If you need something more custom, you can follow our getting started guide to bootstrap Mortar into your workflow!

### Automated Installation
The easiest way to get started is using the [Mortar Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/generator-mortar) that we've created.  Simply `npm install -g generator-mortar` then run `yo mortar` to get up and running in no time.

### Manual Installation
If you like to have more manual control, you can `npm install mortarjs`.  It will require a little customization to get the framework bootstrapped.  Check out the wiki page ["Getting Stared"](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/Mortar-JS/wiki/Getting-Started) form more information.

## Documentation
Local documentation can be generated by running `npm run document` in the Mortar JS root directory.

You can also view the documentation [online](http://docs.mortarjs.io).  This documentation was generated automatically using the js-doc blocks in the files.  For more extensive documentation and implementation examples, see the [playground](http://playground.mortarjs.io).

## Demo
We've created a [playground](http://playground.mortarjs.io) with examples of all the components that are included with Mortar, how they are used, and what they do.  We're working on expanding this site to be useful to designers, managers, and developers alike.  Right now, you can play with the basic components, but soon we'll show off all built-in configurations, as well as provide documentation with code blocks showing how to implement every example on the site.

## Contributing
Contributions come in many forms: code, documentation, issues, etc.  We're open and excited about any contributions that you can offer.  If you're not sure where to start, feel free to reach out to the team.  Otherwise, just jump in!  Soon, as the issue tracker gets filled up, contributing will become more defined.


## Users
Mortar has been in development for about 5 months.  It started being developed internally at [Fuzz](http://www.fuzzproductions.com) for client work.  After the second project that leveraged Mortar for the Admin UI, it became clear that this could be a valuable resource to the open source community.

Right now, Mortar is being used on 3 production sites, with more on the way.

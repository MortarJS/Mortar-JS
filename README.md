Mortar JS is an open source framework built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) that makes interacting and updating data quick, easy, & powerful.  Mortar can best be described as an Admin UI or simple CMS. With Mortar developers can quickly build sites to interface with an API and allow users to safely interface with data.

Mortar is composed of multiple *Bricks* (components) that work together to display and edit data.  Tables, modal windows, buttons, form inputs & more are all included.  Checkout the [demo](http://playground.mortarjs.io) to see the Bricks in action!

## Getting Started
Mortar is very easy to plug and play.  We recommend using the Yeoman generator that we've created to get up and running in no time.  If you need something more custom, you can follow our getting started guide to bootstrap Mortar into your workflow!  Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/Mortar-JS/wiki) for more information on developing with Mortar.

### Automated Installation
The easiest way to get started is using the [Mortar Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/generator-mortar) that we've created.  Simply `npm install -g generator-mortar` then run `yo mortar` to get build a simple project scaffolding.

### Manual Installation
If you like to have more manual control you can `npm install mortarjs`. This approach will require a little customization to get the framework bootstrapped.  Check out the wiki page ["Getting Stared"](https://github.com/fuzz-productions/Mortar-JS/wiki/Getting-Started) for more information.

## Documentation
You can view the [documentation online](https://doclets.io/fuzz-productions/Mortar-JS/master).  This documentation was generated automatically using the js-doc blocks in the source files.  For more extensive documentation and implementation examples, see the [playground](http://playground.mortarjs.io).

Documentation can also be generated locally by running `npm run document` in the Mortar JS root directory.

## Demo
We've created a [playground](http://playground.mortarjs.io) with examples of all the components that are included with Mortar, how they are used, and what they do.  We're working on expanding this site to be useful to designers, managers, and developers alike.  Right now, you can play with the basic components, but soon we'll show off all built-in configurations, as well as provide documentation with code blocks showing how to implement every example on the site.

The [playground](http://playground.mortarjs.io) itself was also built with Mortar! Check out the `/examples` directory in this repo to view the source.

## Contributing
Contributions come in many forms: code, documentation, issues, etc.  We're open and excited about any contributions that you can offer.  If you're not sure where to start, feel free to reach out to the team.  Otherwise, just jump in!

If you contribute and your changes get merged into the project we will send you a __free Mortar JS t-shirt!__ _(while supplies last)_
